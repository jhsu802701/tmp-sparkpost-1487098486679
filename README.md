# Temporary SparkPost App

Welcome to Temporary SparkPost App!
This is a template created by following the 
[Rails From Scratch] (http://www.rubyonracetracks.com/rails_from_scratch.html) protocol.
This template is used by the 
[GenericApp] (https://github.com/jhsu802701/generic_app)
gem for starting off a new app by copying a high-quality pre-existing app.
This saves time, because it's MUCH quicker and easier to modify an existing app 
than it is to create a new one completely from scratch.
